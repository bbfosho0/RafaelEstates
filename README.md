# Inspiration
Throughout life I have always had a fixation with becoming financially independent. Because of this, I've found myself heavily invested in real estate. This has led me to ocasionally viewing properties through various sites and apps. Using Javascript, React, Tailwind CSS, and an ![API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/bayut/) which helps to query real estate in United Arab Emirates dirham (UAE), I've managed to create and deploy my very own real estate app!

# Next Steps & Features
* Currency converter
* Expand database for query of properties for sale/rent
* "Save property for later" feature
* Price update notifications
